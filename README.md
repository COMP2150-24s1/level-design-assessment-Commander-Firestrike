<!-- word count before my writing: ~600, therefore the word count at the end should be ~2100-->

## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
<!-- Outline and justify how your level design facilitates the core player experience goals outlined in the assignment spec. Each section should be supported by specific examples and screenshots of your game encounters that highlight design choices made to facilitate that particular experience. -->

### 1.1. Discovery
<!-- What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice? -->
- the player learns the different mechanics in the first section and then how they can interact in later sections
- my design facilitates learning by introducing new mechanics one at a time and in safe environments to allow the player to to learn without the pressure of a game over

### 1.2. Drama
<!-- What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief?  -->
- my design facilitates increasing intensity by constantly increasing the challenge with every encounter
- my desing facilitates moments of tension and relief by keeping challenges separated by more low-intensity encounters

### 1.3. Challenge
<!-- What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel? -->
- the main challenges are the nuanced control of the character and weapons for platforming
- I have designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel by increasing the challenge as they progress, with later encounters being more complex and having more mechanics used

### 1.4. Exploration
<!-- How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places? -->
- my level design facilitates autonomy and invites the player to explore by not being totally linear, and providing rewards to players who explore 
    - section 1 has a hub area which connects to two other areas which each introduce a few mechanics
    - section 2 and 3 are connected by a hub area, and each section has a distinct theme
    - various platforming encounters have a second, more difficult path to take, that rewards the player with a health container
- the aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and places by using unique design language
    - section 2 and 3 each have their own theme and style
    - the hub areas are revisited and become more memorable that way

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
<!-- A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures. -->

<!-- Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level. -->

### 2.1. Acid

### 2.2. Checkpoints

### 2.3. Chompers

### 2.4. Health Pickups

### 2.5. Keys

### 2.6. Moving Platforms

### 2.7. Passthrough Platforms

### 2.8. Spikes

### 2.9. Spitters

### 2.10. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
<!-- A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams). -->
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3. Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4. Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
<!-- Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design. -->
- I struggled with following the design process from storyboarding through diagrams to greyboxing, as I am not a very creative person
- I found it much easier to go straight into Unity and experiment with the prefabs 
- I still iterated on my design, but found it difficult to apply the diagramming techniques to this process
- My design process was as follows:
    1. Experiment with the prefabs to get an understanding of how they work
    2. Mock up some simple encounters to get an idea of what I want the level to be and what mechanics I wanted to focus on
    3. Create a storyboard for the dramatic pacing of the level
    4. Create a molecule diagram for how each of the 3 sections are going to connect and some of their internal details, based on the storyboard
    5. Create the first section in Unity to introduce the mechanics
    6. Create a lot of individual, separated encounters in Unity based on certain mechanics and prefabs for the second and third sections
    7. Connect each encounter together in Unity in a way that follows dramatic pacing, while constantly testing and modifying the encounters to better target the desired player experience
- Despite not using diagramming tools very much, I still believe I iterated effectively by testing every change to ensure the desired player experience was met
